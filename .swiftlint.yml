# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
 - trailing_whitespace
 - identifier_name
 - line_length
 - nesting
excluded: # paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`.
  - Pods
  - R.generated.swift
  - ./*/*/DataProvider.swift
